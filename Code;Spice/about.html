                    <p class="content is-medium">Code;Spice is a coding camp completely free of charge for kids of all ages that would like to learn Python,
                        relatively simple algorithmic thinking, how to get started on their own project, or just the coding philosophy 
                        in general. The classes are separated into two types of classes. The advanced class works on more complex projects like USACO, websites, games, you name it! 
                        The beginners class is more for reinforcing and getting proficient at Python. Throughout the school year, we will be meeting once a week for each type of class for 1.5 hours, 
                        in addition to optional 2 hour long office hours for both classes to help students with questions or problems. 
                        Recordings of classes will be posted for participants that missed classes, so don't worry about being a latecomer or missing any classes! 
                        In the end, we hope for participants to not only learn how to code, but to learn how to code more efficiently, and most importantly, have fun!</p>

                                at Manalapan High School and have also been studying in the Columbia University Science Honors Program (SHP). I am pretty experienced in the languages Python, HTML/CSS (yep, I made this website myself), C++, and is currently learning Java. 
                                Oustside of school and programming, I like to play volleyball, do fencing, and play piano. When I'm feeling more productive, I enjoy doing competitive math and coding,
                                working on projects, or honing my own coding skills. Currently, I have passed USACO bronze and I am preparing for USACO silver. 
                                This is my <a href="https://github.com/Xiangggggg" target="_blank">Github</a> if you are curious about seeing some projects I've made in the past.</p>

                                    I am experienced in multiple languages like Python, Java, and HTML/CSS and am also interested in new technologies like
                                    Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, and Robotics. I like to play videogames, play the piano, or watch shows in my free time.
                                    Otherwise, I like to do competitive math, make personal projects of mine, and improve my own programming skills.
